SwordStone is a retro 2D pixel art game developed in C++ using the SFML library. The player takes on the role of a knight in a dungeon filled with enemies, treasures, and challenges, while utilizing object-oriented programming concepts to implement animations, collisions, and other interactive game elements.

## Presentation and Motivation 🎮

The choice of the SwordStone project was driven by the desire to explore and deepen object-oriented programming concepts in a practical and engaging context. By developing this 2D game, I aimed to implement fundamental principles of OOP, such as encapsulation and inheritance, to create a dynamic and lively gaming experience.

Implementing a retro-style game in pixel art brought interesting opportunities for design and development, and using the SFML library provided a friendly and robust environment for managing graphics, sounds, and player interactions. Through this project, my goal was to learn and apply good programming practices, code structuring, and resource management in a complex development environment.

Throughout the documentation, I will explore in detail how I used object-oriented programming concepts to implement the game's functionalities. I will describe animation and collision elements, as well as various tools and techniques used to facilitate the creation of this captivating game. By documenting and explaining the development process, I aim to provide readers with a clear understanding of how OOP can be applied in a real-world context and inspire them to explore the potential of this paradigm in their own projects.

In the following sections, I will delve into implementation details and provide practical examples to highlight the advantages and importance of object-oriented programming in game development.
